Differences between Document and Window Objects

                     Documents object                                                                           Windows object

It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.          It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
It is loaded inside the window.                                                     It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
It is the object of window property.                                                It is the object of the browser.
We can access the document from a window using the window. document                 We can access the window from the window only.
The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)  The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies,                        Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title            
syntax: document.propertyname;                                                      syntax: window.propertyname;
Example document.title :  will return the title of the document                     Example window.innerHeight:will return the height of the content area of the browser.
